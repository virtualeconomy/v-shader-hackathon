# Usage

Please note that, in accordance with the limits imposed by the V Hackathon, your shader build file cannot exceed 16kb. The tutorials included in this repository may offer insights into more complex shader functionalities, e.g., mouse interactions â€“ they are not mandatory to join the Hackathon and can be integrated only as long as the size of the file does not exceed 16kb.

All for viewing example just host /dist folder for example by Penguin (could be installed by `cargo install penguin-app`)

```bash
$ penguin serve ./dist
```

## Building

Build

```bash
$ make build-all
```

## Evnironment and Dependencies

Linux ennvironment is expected for building process.

Build tools uses:

1. `Trunk` Installation instructions are [here](https://trunkrs.dev/#install)
2. `wasm-strip` is part of wabt toolkit, you can download from [wabt releases](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/releases) <b>OR</b> here is [build instruction](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) <b>OR</b> you can comment out line of usage from build.sh
3. `wasm-opt` is part of binaryen toolkit, installation instructions [here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen?tab=readme-ov-file#releases) <b>OR</b> you can comment out line of usage from build.sh
4. `sed` and `bash` usually already installed on every linux machine

Or in case of linux simply run this to install all prerequisites

```bash
make deps-install
```

## Shaders

### Uniforms

Following uniforms are automatically declared for all fragment shaders similar to shadertoys.

| Declaration               | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uniform vec3 iResolution; | The viewport resolution (z is pixel aspect ratio, usually 1.0) |
| uniform float iTime;      | Current time in seconds                                        |
| uniform float iTimeDelta; | Time it takes to render a frame, in seconds                    |
| uniform int iFrame;       | Current frame                                                  |
| uniform float iFrameRate; | Number of frames rendered per second                           |
| uniform vec4 iMouse;      | xy = current pixel coords (if LMB is down). zw = click pixel   |
| uniform vec4 iDate;       | Year, month, day, time in seconds in .xyzw                     |

### Pixel Shader

Pixel shader should have following format (similar to shadertoys):

```GLSL
void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Could be some calculations
    fragColor = vec4( 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 );
}
```

All other declaration should be compatible with GLSL

## API

### function set_fragment_shader(new_shader_code: string): void;

Passes shader code to WASM, if not called then default shader from shaders/shader.frag would be loaded

### function update_player_state(state: any): void;

Sets param of shader playback.

By default state is empty (player is unpaused, all uniforms (except iMouse) are calculated automatically), but it could be set like this:

```JavaScript
{
    uniforms: {
        resolution: {
            width: 1920,
            height: 1080,
            pixel_aspect_ratio: 1
        },
        time: 3600, // real time at start, but dependent from pause and speed
        time_delta: 0.02,   // dependent from speed
        frame: 100,
        frame_rate: 50,
        mouse: {
            x: 0,
            y: 0,
            down_x: 0,
            down_y: 0
        },
        date: {
            year: 2024,
            month: 10,
            day: 30,
            time: 3600  // real time, doesn't depend from pause or speed
        }
    },
    playback: {
        paused: true,   // Freezes iTime uniform and stops render
        speed: 1.0  // Speed can be negative (in this case iTime decreases and playback is backward) and zero (in this case iTime freezes, but this option doesn't stop render)
    }
}
```

<i> Once any uniform is set, it would not be calculated automatically until page refresh. Exception is iMouse, it could be set only via update_player_state() </i>

If loaded shader doesn't use some of listed uniforms, then rewriting it will not take effect

### function stop(state: any): void;

Stops animation till play() call

### function play(state: any): void;

Resumes animation after stop() call

### Event TrunkApplicationStarted

Emits on WASM finish loading

### Event WasmErrorEvent
<!-- qqq : ? -->

Emits when error occurred (console.log also prints error info independently). Usage example:

```Javascript
addEventListener("WasmErrorEvent", (event) => {
    // `event.detail` contains error message.
    alert(event.detail);
});
```

## Minimal code to start

1. For initialization calling `init` from js shipped with wasm is enough

```html
<script type="module" nonce="u4yenYsZSS48mOe0heMQug==">
  import init, * as bindings from "/wasm_shader_runner-32edfc57ede5ba0d.js";
  const wasm = await init("/wasm_shader_runner-32edfc57ede5ba0d_bg.wasm");

  window.wasmBindings = bindings;

  dispatchEvent(
    new CustomEvent("TrunkApplicationStarted", { detail: { wasm } })
  );
</script>
<link
  rel="modulepreload"
  href="/wasm_shader_runner-32edfc57ede5ba0d.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  integrity="sha384-VjfC0Ntqs7xkTz8AA5BTur2hnet1K9tqQ7bj8uSwYubAEK6UIXyRf0R9SeeTuX8+"
/>
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="/wasm_shader_runner-32edfc57ede5ba0d_bg.wasm"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  integrity="sha384-zVsc6mQjH++FC5WYSj3OEKfKrSiJd4iNxuhf0q3W5JdyMAV4Pbo1QKA1NZEYNfqh"
  as="fetch"
  type="application/wasm"
/>
```

In this code example paths of js and wasm contains hex value `32edfc57ede5ba0d` which may differ in files after running build script.
